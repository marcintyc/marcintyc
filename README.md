### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am Marcin. I work as a Mainframe Specialist in kyndryl (new IBM company). I enjoy programming and have grown passionately in this direction for several years. Especially in Java, JavaScript and React. I am interested in cloud technologies and am in the process of Azure certification. I love learning new things using mnemonics. I participate in Polish Championship competitions and in the near future I plan to participate in international competitions.
Let's stay in touch!
